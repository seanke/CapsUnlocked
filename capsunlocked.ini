# CapsUnlocked config
# Hold CapsLock to activate the layer.

# [modifiers] section (optional): Define keys that act as layer modifiers.
# Keys listed here can be held while the layer is active to enable additional mappings.
# These keys are reserved and cannot be used as source or target keys in mappings.

# Mapping syntax:
#   [app] [source] [target]                (no modifiers)
#   [app] [mods source] [target]           (mods first, source last inside middle bracket)
#   [mac app] [...], [win app] [...]       (optional platform filter in the app bracket)
#
# When modifiers are held, more specific mappings take priority.
# Examples:
#   [*] [a s] [j] [Shift End]   - when 'a' and 's' are held, 'j' sends Shift+End
#   [*] [] [j] [Down]           - when no modifiers are held, 'j' sends Down

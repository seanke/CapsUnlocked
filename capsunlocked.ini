# CapsUnlocked config
# Hold CapsLock to activate the layer.

# [modifiers] section (optional): Define keys that act as layer modifiers.
# Keys listed here can be held while the layer is active to enable additional mappings.
# These keys are reserved and cannot be used as source or target keys in mappings.
# [modifiers]
# a
# s

# Mapping syntax:
#   Legacy format: app source target
#   New format:    [app] [source] [target]          (no modifiers)
#                  [app] [mods] [source] [target]   (with modifiers)
#
# When modifiers are held, more specific mappings take priority.
# Examples:
#   [*] [a s] [j] [Shift End]   - when 'a' and 's' are held, 'j' sends Shift+End
#   [*] [] [j] [Down]           - when no modifiers are held, 'j' sends Down

# Default vim-style arrow keys (all apps)

*                   j   Down
*                   k   Up
